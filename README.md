I have also honed my skills by solving over 1000 coding problems on platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and PepCoding, demonstrating my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. Whether you are looking to build a new website from scratch or improve the performance of an existing one, I have the skills and experience to deliver exceptional results.
